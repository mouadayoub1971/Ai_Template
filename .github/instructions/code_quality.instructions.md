rules:
  - Keep code minimal, clean, and easy to read.  
  - Split logic into small, focused files/modules (avoid one big file).  
  - Write short functions/components with a single responsibility.  
  - Use clear and consistent naming (no abbreviations, no vague names).  
  - Avoid duplication — extract reusable parts when patterns repeat.  
  - Prefer simplicity over cleverness (no over-engineering).  
  - Add comments only where the intent isn’t obvious from the code.  
  - Ensure code is extensible without rewriting large parts.  
  - Apply relevant design patterns when they improve clarity and maintainability.  
  - Respect SOLID principles to ensure scalability and flexibility.
