- Keep code minimal, clean, and easy to read.  
- Split logic into small, focused files/modules (avoid one big file).  
- Write short functions/components with a single responsibility.  
- Use clear and consistent naming (no abbreviations, no vague names).  
- Avoid duplication — extract reusable parts when patterns repeat.  
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness (no over-engineering).  
- Add comments only where the intent isn’t obvious from the code.  
- Ensure code is extensible without rewriting large parts.  
- Apply relevant design patterns when they improve clarity and maintainability.  
- Respect SOLID principles to ensure scalability and flexibility.
